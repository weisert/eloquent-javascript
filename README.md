# Eloquent Javascript.

[Eloquent Javascript](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593272820) is a perfect book that contains a lot of excercises. Doing them using [code sendbox](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/) gives less fun then doing them localy running a bunch of unit tests against your code.

Steps to set up local environment:

1.   Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)
2.   Run the following code:

        git clone https://github.com/weisert/eloquent-javascript.git
        cd eloquent-javascript
        npm install
        npm test
